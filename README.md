# OpenType Feature Bundle for Textmate/Sublime Text

This covers Adobeâ€™s [OpenType Feature File Specification](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html) used by the AFDKO. As well as syntax highlighting, there are also a couple of snippets for creating features, tables etc.

My thanks to [Tal Leming](http://www.typesupply.com/) for contributing some snippets and keywords before this became a Github project.

I'm more than happy to accept pull requests!
